*** Building Spim for DOS ***
********************************

Introduction
------------

This document describes the process you'll need to go through if you'd
like to build a new copy of Spim from source code.  If you're not
experienced with UNIX development, it might be a little more in-depth
than you'll want to tackle, but feel free to give it a shot!


Source Code
-----------
The first thing you'll need is the source code itself.  This can be
obtained at ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/spim/spim.tar.gz.  You'll need
the 'tar' and 'gunzip' utilities, or similar tools which can handle
these formats (such as Niko Mak's WinZip) to extract the sources.
Place this file in a directory of your choice (I'll assume C:\SPIMSRC)
and name it spimtar.gz.
To extract the source code, use commands similar to the following:
  gzip -d spimtar.gz
  tar xvf spimtar

Now, you need tools for building.


Compiler & Tools
----------------
Next, you'll need the development tools, for compiling the source.
Since SPIM was developed originally for UNIX, a DOS port of GNU C++
called DJGPP is used for building Spim for DOS.  You can obtain
everything you'll need at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/.
We'll only be using DJGPP 2.01 (v2), so don't bother with the v1
folders at all.

You should download the following:
  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2/djdev201.zip    (DJGPP base)

  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/txt122b.zip  (text utils)

In addition, if you wish to build a completely stand-alone version
of SPIM that does not require a DPMI server (Windows provides one
when you run in a DOS box), you'll also need to obtain a copy of PMODE/DJ.
You can get it at:
  ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2misc/pmode11b.zip

To install the DJGPP utils you just downloaded, all you need is a copy
of pkunzip, or a similar utility that can extract .ZIP files.  Create
a directory for DJGPP and its tools to live in (We assume C:\DJGPP in this
document).  Now, just unzip all of the files you downloaded into that
directory.  Here are some example commands.
  Using PKWARE's pkunzip:    pkunzip *.zip -d -o C:\DJGPP 
  Using INFOZIP's unzip:     unzip -d C:\DJGPP *.zip

Once you have everything extracted, you will find a file named
"setdjgpp.bat" in the C:\DJGPP\bin directory.  Copy this file into a
directory in your path (C:\DOS, for example).  Edit it, and replace the
occurances of "%2" with "C:/DJGPP".  After the line that reads
"rem  Don't forget to change your Path!", add a line that reads
"SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\DJGPP\BIN".  Save and exit, and type "SETDJGPP" at
the command prompt.  You may want to add a line that reads
"call SETDJGPP.BAT" to your autoexec.bat file, to automatically set up the
environment for you at boot-time.  You're now ready to use the compiler.


Building
--------
Now that you have the source code, and the necessary tools, you're ready
to build the code.  Go to the spim source directory, and rename the
file "MAKEFILE.DOS" to "MAKEFILE".

Now, type "make".  When the build finsihes, you should have a working
copy of spim.exe.

If you plan on using pmode, you'll need to edit this makefile, and
change the "PMODESTUB =" line to refer to your djgpp\bin directory.
Then, type "make pmode" at the command prompt.  This will append the
PMODE/DJ stub to the front of the SPIM.EXE, enabling it to run on
any DOS platform, with or without a DPMI server.

That's it!
