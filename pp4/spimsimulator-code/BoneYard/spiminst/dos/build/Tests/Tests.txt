*** Sample test code for SPIM ***
*********************************

This directory contains several test files that can be used to verify
the successful installation and operation of your copy of SPIM.
The files with the .OK extension (ex: alubare.ok) contain the expected
output from running these programs.

Feel free to use these files as examples or starting points for your
own projects.

*** Files and descriptions ***
******************************

alubare.s: -bare -notrap
	Tests the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) of the simulator.

bare.s: -bare -notrap
	Tests the bare instruction support.

fpubare.s: -bare -notrap
	Tests the FPU (Floating Point Unit) of the simulator.

io.s: -mapped_io
	Tests the mapped I/O facilities of the simulator.
	Just type in any six lines.  If it finishes without error, it worked.

allinsts.s: -mapped_io
	A complete instruction test.
	allinsts.in is the expected input for this program.
	Try: spim -mapped_io -file allinsts.s < allinsts.in
