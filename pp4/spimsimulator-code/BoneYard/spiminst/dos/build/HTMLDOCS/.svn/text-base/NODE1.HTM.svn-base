SPIM S20 is a simulator that runs programs for the MIPS R2000/R3000 RISC
computers.<A NAME="tex2html2" HREF="footnode.htm#950"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot.gif"></A> SPIM
can read and immediately execute files containing assembly language.  SPIM
is a self-contained system for running these programs and contains a
debugger and interface to a few operating system services.
<P>
The architecture of the MIPS computers is simple and regular, which
makes it easy to learn and understand.  The processor contains 32
general-purpose registers and a well-designed instruction set that
make it a propitious target for generating code in a compiler.
<P>
However, the obvious question is: why use a simulator when many people
have workstations that contain a hardware, and hence significantly
faster, implementation of this computer?  One reason is that these
workstations are not generally available.  Another reason is that
these machine will not persist for many years because of the rapid
progress leading to new and faster computers.  Unfortunately, the
trend is to make computers faster by executing several instructions
concurrently, which makes their architecture more difficult to
understand and program.  The MIPS architecture may be the epitome of a
simple, clean RISC machine.
<P>
In addition, simulators can provide a better environment for low-level
programming than an actual machine because they can detect more errors
and provide more features than an actual computer.  For example, SPIM
has a X-window interface that is better than most debuggers for the
actual machines.
<P>
Finally, simulators are an useful tool for studying computers and the
programs that run on them.  Because they are implemented in software,
not silicon, they can be easily modified to add new instructions,
build new systems such as multiprocessors, or simply to collect data.
