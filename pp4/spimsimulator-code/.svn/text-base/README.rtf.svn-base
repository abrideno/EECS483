                                      GETTING SPIM SOURCE\par
                                      ===================\par
\par
Spim is hosted on SourceForge and its source code is available through SVN:\par
{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/ }}{\fldrslt{https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22\par

                                          DIRECTORIES\par
                                          ===========\par
\par
The subdirectories can be divided into two categories.\par
\par
1. Common to all versions of Spim:\par
\par
    CPU -- Contains the MIPS simulator and some utility functions common to all version of the\par
           simulator.\par
\par
    Documentation -- Contains the man pages, web page, and other documentation.\par
\par
    bin -- Utilities.\par
\par
    Setup -- Contain tools used to build deployable versions of the simulators.\par
\par
    Tests -- Contains regression test for the simulator.\par
\par
    Boneyard -- Copies of the recent releases of Spim.\par
\par
\par
2. Front-ends for different versions of Spim:\par
\par
    PCSpim -- Microsoft Windows front end for Spim.\par
\par
    QtSpim -- Front end for Spim that works on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.\par
\par
    spim -- Text-only (terminal or console) front end for Spim. Works on all platforms.\par
\par
    xspim -- X-Windows front end for Spim. Works on Linux and Mac OS X. (Built on a very old\par
             X Windows library that is no longer supported by the Mac.)\par
\par
\par
                                        BUILDING QTSPIM\par
                                        ===============\par
\par
It is generally not necessary to build QtSpim as the Spim website contains an installable\par
version for most systems.\par
\par
Install the bison parser generator and flex lexer generator, either using Cygwin on Windows or\par
native on Linux.\par
\par
1. Download the free (open source) version of Qt Creator from\par
   {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ }}{\fldrslt{http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 . This is a large download that might take a while.\par
\par
        The open source version of Qt Creator for Windows, which uses mingw, works fine, as does\par
        the version (which you need to build yourself) that uses Microsoft Visual Studio's C++\par
        compiler.\par
\par
        The Qt Creator package for Ubuntu is an old version, which has some problems with\par
        QtSPIM.  Download a recent version from {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ }}{\fldrslt{http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
\par
        The Mac Qt SDK is located at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-mac-os-cpp }}{\fldrslt{http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-mac-os-cpp\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
\par
2. Start QtCreator and open the file QtSpim/QtSpim.pro.\par
\par
3. Compile QtSpim.\par
\par
        If you are porting to a new system and see a large number of compiler errors in\par
        QtCreator, changes are good that you need to change QtSpim.pro to define the compiler\par
        flag that says "treat all files, including .c files, as C++ code. This flag is "-X C++"\par
        for gcc and "-TP" for the Microsoft compiler.\par
\par
\par
                                    BUILDING SPIM and XSPIM\par
                                    =======================\par
\par
It is necessary to build spim and xspim, as they are only distributed as source.\par
\par
   1. Download the source for spimsimulator from sourceforge\par
   ({{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/ }}{\fldrslt{https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 ), either through Subversion from the\par
   spimsimulator repository ({{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/ }}{\fldrslt{http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 ) or\par
   by downloading a tarball\par
   ({{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/?view=tar }}{\fldrslt{http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/?view=tar\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 ).\par
\par
   2. Decompress the file, using either the program uncompress for the first file or gzip for\par
      the second file:\par
\par
          % uncompress spim.tar.Z\par
\par
      or\par
\par
          % gzip -d spim.tar.gz\par
\par
   3. Move the file spim.tar to the directory in which you want to build spim and untar it:\par
\par
          % tar xf spim.tar\par
\par
      It will create a directory named spim-8.0 (or the most recent version number).\par
\par
   4. The simple terminal interface is contained in the spim-8.0/spim directory and the\par
   X-windows interfaces is in the spim-8.0/xspim directory. The other directories are described\par
   in the README file.\par
\par
   5. Next, you must set the directories in which spim will be installed by editing the Makefile\par
   (the file that contains instructions on building spim). In general, if you are installing\par
   spim and want the windowing version (xspim), edit the file xspim/Imakefile. If you don't want\par
   xspim or are running on a system without X-windows installed, you use the file spim/Makefile.\par
\par
      The programs are installed in standard locations, but you can change the pathnames to other locations:\par
\par
          EXCEPTION_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which to install the spim exception handler (exceptions.s).\par
\par
          BIN_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which spim and xspim should be installed.\par
\par
          MAN_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which the manual pages for spim and xspim should be installed.\par
\par
      In general, the remaining parameters in a Makefile need not be changed.\par
\par
   6. Then, if you are building xspim, change to the spim-8.0/xspim directory and type:\par
\par
          % xmkmf\par
          % make\par
\par
      If you do not have a copy of xmkmf, you can use the Makefile in the xspim directory, but\par
      beware that it may not work on your system because the paths to the X windows libraries\par
      could be different.\par
\par
   7. If you do not have X-windows, change to thespim-8.0/spim directory, edit Makefile, and type:\par
\par
          % make\par
\par
   8. To run spim or xspim, the exception handler must be installed in the directory specified\par
   by the variable EXCEPTION_DIR in the Makefile. If the file exception.s is not installed, spim\par
   and xspim fail before they start running. You can either install this file by hand or by\par
   typing:\par
\par
          % make install\par
\par
   which also installs spim or xspim, and the manual pages in the directories that you set\par
   (above). You may need root permission to install these files, in which case type:\par
\par
          % sudo make install\par
\par
   9. To test that spim is correctly built, change to the spim-8.0/spim directory and type:\par
\par
          % make test\par
\par
      and examine the output of the test. (Note: the exception handler must be installed before\par
      running the test.)\par
\par
\par
                                        BUILDING PCSPIM\par
                                        ===============\par
\par
It is not necessary to compile PCSpim (the Microsoft Windows version), as the Spim web site\par
contains a precompiled version.\par
\par
The Microsoft Windows version of Spim is called PCSpim and is built using Microsoft Visual\par
Studio.\par
\par
spim (the terminal version) works well on Microsoft Windows.  You can easily build it using the\par
Cygwin port of the GNU tools (see {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK www.cygwin.com }}{\fldrslt{www.cygwin.com\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 ).\par
\par
\par
\par
                                      NEW VERSIONS OF SPIM\par
                                      ===================\par
\par
I generally release new version of SPIM once a year, before a semester boundary (late August or\par
early January).  The new version are available on:\par
\par
\tab\tab {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/ }}{\fldrslt{https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22\par
