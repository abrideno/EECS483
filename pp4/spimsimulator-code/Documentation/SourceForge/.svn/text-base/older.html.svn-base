<h2><a name="older">Older Versions of SPIM</a></h2>
<strong>The information describes the older versions of s<em>pim</em>. 
Don&#39;t use them! Switch to </strong><i><strong>QtSpim</strong></i><strong> instead.<br />
</strong><br />
<br />
Older versions of the various simulators are in the BoneYard directory of the 
SourceForge repository:
<a href="http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/BoneYard/">
http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/BoneYard/</a>. 
Some of the versions are ready to run, but many need to be compiled.
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>To run <i>PCspim</i> for Microsoft Windows, download the PCSpim.zip file 
	from the BoneYard directory, 
	unzip it, and click on <i>setup.exe</i>. Source for the Microsoft Windows version (<i>PCspim</i>) 
	is available in those directories. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To run <em>spim</em> or <i>xspim</i> on a Unix, Linux, or Mac OS X system, 
	get the source code from the
	<a href="http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/">SourceForge 
	repository</a> and compile it for your system.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There is no precompiled Mac version (but there is a <em>
	QtSpim</em> version). However, <i>xspim</i> compiles and runs on Mac OS X if 
	you can find a way to install the Xaw library.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Versions of <em>Spim</em>

 before 7.0 implemented the MIPS-I instruction 
set used on the MIPS R2000/R3000 computers. This architecture is obsolete (though, 
never surpassed for its simplicity and elegance). <em>Spim</em>

 now supports the more 
modern MIPS32 architecture, which is the MIPS-I instruction set augmented with a 
large number of occasionally useful instructions. MIPS code from earlier versions 
of SPIM should run without changes, <span class="style1">
except</span>
 code that handles exceptions and 
interrupts. This part of the architecture changed over time (and was poorly implemented 
in earlier versions of <em>Spim</em>). This type of code will need to be updated. 
Examples of new exception handling are in the files: exceptions.s and Tests/tt.io.s.</p>

<h2><a name="installing">Installing Older Versions of SPIM</a></h2>
<h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>To run <i>PCspim</i> under Microsoft Windows, download the PCSpim.zip file 
	from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Unzip the file.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click on the <i>setup.exe</i> program.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Unix, Linux, or Mac OS X</h3>
<p>Installation is a bit more complex for these system, as you need to compile the 
program for your particular computer and operating system.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Download the files from the
	<a href="http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/">SourceForge 
	repository</a>. At the bottom of the list of files, there is a link to download 
	a GNU tarball, which will get all the files in the latest version of the system. 
	You don&#39;t need the Boneyard directory, which contains old versions, or QtSpim, 
	but the other directories are useful.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The simple terminal interface is contained in the <i>spim</i> subdirectory 
	and the X-windows interface is in the <i>xspim</i> subdirectory .<i> </i>The 
	other directories are described in the README file.<i> </i></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Next, you must set the directories in which <em>Spim</em> will be installed 
	by editing the <i>Makefile</i> (the file that contains instructions on building
	<em>Spim</em>). In general, if you are installing <em>Spim</em> and want the 
	windowing version (<i>xspim</i>), edit the file <i>xspim/Imakefile</i> . If 
	you don&#39;t want <i>xspim</i> or are running on a system without X-windows installed, 
	use the file <i>spim/Makefile</i>.<br />
	<br />
	The programs are installed in standard locations, but you can change to other 
	locations:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXCEPTION_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in 
	which to install the <em>Spim</em> exception handler <i>(exceptions.s</i>)<i>.</i></p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BIN_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory in which
	<em>spim</em> and <i>xspim</i> should be installed.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAN_DIR -- The full pathname of the directory for the 
	man pages for <em>spim</em> and <i>xspim</i>.<br />
	<br />
	In general, the remaining parameters in a <i>Makefile</i> need not be changed.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you are building <i>xspim</i>, change to the <i>xspim </i>subdirectory<i>
	</i>and type:<br />
	<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>% xmkmf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % make<br />
	<br />
	</i>If your systems do not have <i>xmkmf</i> installed, you can use the <i>Makefile</i> 
	in the <i>xspim</i> subdirectory, but beware that it may not work on your system 
	because the paths to the X windows libraries could be different. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you do not have X-windows, change to the<i> spim</i> subdirectory, edit
	<i>Makefile,</i> and type: <br />
	<br />
	<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % make&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To run <em>spim</em> or <i>xspim</i>, the exception handler must be installed 
	in the directory specified by EXCEPTION_DIR in the <i>Makefile</i>. If <i>exception.s</i> 
	is not installed, <em>spim</em> and <i>xspim</i> fail before they start running. 
	You can either install this file by hand or by typing: <br />
	<br />
	<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % make install</i><br />
	<br />
	which also installs <em>spim</em> or <i>xspim</i>, and the man pages. You may 
	need root permission to install these files, in which case type: <br />
	<br />
	<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % sudo make install</i><br />
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To test that <em>Spim</em> is correctly built, change to the <i>spim </i>
	subdirectory and type:<br />
	<br />
	<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % make test</i><br />
	<br />
	and examine the output of the test. (Note: the exception handler must be installed 
	before running the test.)</p>
	</li>
